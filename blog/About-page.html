          In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
          elements on a web page. When an element has been targeted, a style or
          set of styles can be applied to the element. <br /><br />CSS has a
          wide range of selectors available to customize your project. The two
          selectors most commonly used are class and ID. Both of these selectors
          are used to target elements to which the style should be applied.
          <br /><br />When you design a web page, it requires applying certain
          styles and formatting to get the desired look you want. This is where
          CSS Selectors come into play. <br /><br />Selectors give the user the
          ability to target specific elements on a web page that you can apply
          styles to. CSS has various types of selectors available such as,
          universal selectors, descendant selectors, child selectors, and
          grouping selectors. This blog will just focus on class selectors and
          id selectors. <br /><br />The two selectors, class and id, are used to
          apply styles to elements based on the class and ID assigned to an HTML
          element.
