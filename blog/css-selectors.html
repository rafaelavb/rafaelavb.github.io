          In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
          elements on a web page. When an element has been targeted, a style or
          set of styles can be applied to the element. <br /><br />CSS has a
          wide range of selectors available to customize your project. The two
          selectors most commonly used are class and ID. Both of these selectors
          are used to target elements to which the style should be applied.
          <br /><br />When you design a web page, it requires applying certain
          styles and formatting to get the desired look you want. This is where
          CSS Selectors come into play. <br /><br />Selectors give the user the
          ability to target specific elements on a web page that you can apply
          styles to. CSS has various types of selectors available such as,
          universal selectors, descendant selectors, child selectors, and
          grouping selectors. This blog will just focus on class selectors and
          id selectors. <br /><br />The two selectors, class and id, are used to
          apply styles to elements based on the class and ID assigned to an HTML
          element.

            A class is a selector is used to select all of the elements with the
            specific class name. The selector must start with a period (.) and
            the class name. I have defined my specific class name as
            “blog-post__card”. By using the class selector, the browser will
            look for all tags in the page that have a class attribute containing
            that class name. <br /><br />Why would you use a class selector?
            <br /><br />You would use a class selector when you wanted to select
            one or multiple HTML elements and put that specific style onto those
            elements.

          See an example in the image below of my cards that are on my home

            The left hand side is the HTML file. On the right hand side is the
            CSS file. You can see in the HTML file, each of those individual
            divs are applying the same class “blog-post__card”. This will apply
            the styling defined in the main.css file. If you navigate back to
            the home page of my blog <a href="../index.html"></a>, you will see
            that the 3 cards on the main page are all styled the same. This is
            because they are all using the same class.

            An Id selector is a way to select only the element with a specific
            id and apply styles to that one unique element. The selector must
            start with a hash (#) sign.

        <div>
          <p class="blog-paragraph__paragraph-formatting">
            You would use an Id selector to specify a unique element. Having an
            element with a Id selector is only used to identify one single
            element in our HTML. IDs are only used when one element on the page
            should have a particular style applied to it.

          <h1>Summarizing Class vs ID</h1>
        </div>

        <p class="blog-paragraph__paragraph-formatting">
          When deciding what class id you need to use, think about what elements
          you are trying to apply styles too. If for example, if you’re like me,
          I have made multiple cards on my home page that I want to be the exact
          same and have the same styles, you would use the class id. If you have
          a specific element you want to style which is unique, you would use
          the Id selector. The difference between CSS class and ID is that CSS
          class can apply a style to multiple elements. ID can only apply a
          style to one unique element.
