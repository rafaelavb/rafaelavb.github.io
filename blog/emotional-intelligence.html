        <p class="blog-paragraph__paragraph-formatting">
          Emotional Intelligence (EI) is the ability to be aware and manage
          emotions - both our own and others. You can take a standardized test
          called the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT)
          which is an ability-based test that measures the four branches of
          Mayer and Salovey’s El mode.

        <h1>How is it different to IQ?</h1>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="blog-paragraph__paragraph-formatting">
          Intelligence quotient (IQ) is the measure of a person’s reasoning and
          ability to problem solve. <br><br>EI and IQ differ because EI measures a
          person’s social and emotional competencies and IQ measures a person’s
          academic competency and reasoning ability. <br><br>A good example would be,
          someone who has a high IQ level will theoretically have greater
          success academically in study, where as a person’s EQ level reflects
          success in the real world.

        <h1>Why is it important?</h1>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="blog-paragraph__paragraph-formatting">
          Both EQ and IQ are important but I think EQ is more important for the
          soft skill set in a professional working environment and the real
          world. <br><br>EQ gives you the skill set to recognize and regulate emotion,
          and to use social awareness in problem-solving. EQ in my opinion is a
          far greater tool to have than IQ in software development. The soft
          skill set that comes with EQ allows an individual to work well in a
          team environment. <br><br>IQ gives you the skill set to problem solve which
          would help immensely being a full stack developer, but if you have a
          high IQ and low EQ, you wouldn’t be able to communicate well and work
          in a team environment. <br><br>Both intelligence qualities can drastically
          shape an individuals quality of life and accomplishments.
