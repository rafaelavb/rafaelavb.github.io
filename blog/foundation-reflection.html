          I’ve learn a whole heap about myself through the Dev Academy journey.
          The biggest things would have to be how much content I can learn,
          especially at such a fast rate. When I look back at myself on week 1
          with absolutely no coding experience to week 5 have an in depth view
          into the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript I’m quite amazed.<br><br>
          The next thing would be how applying the concepts of a growth mindset
          changed how I would view my learning through Foundations. <br><br>The last
          thing that I learnt about myself was that I could infant learn to code
          after spending 10 years in the trade.

            What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
            and programming?

            When you’re programming and working In a team, these certain soft
            skills make you a great and valued team member. Most of these soft
            skills will be learnt to some extent through everyday life. By
            studying and understanding the core logic to these soft skills,
            you’re able to be mindful and make more conscious decisions in
            programming as a whole. <br><br>Values are what an individual believes in,
            It is what is most important in someones life. An individuals core
            values guides them through the way they live and work. They
            determine ones priorities and actions. Everyone's core values are
            different but that’s what makes people unique. I think having good
            core values allows someone to work well in a team environment and
            would carry them through a successful career in software
            development. <br><br>Empathy allows someone to emotionally understand what
            other people feel. Working in a team environment means working with
            multiple other people, all who will manage their jobs while juggling
            different lives behind the scenes. People live dynamic lives and
            within that, things do happen. A good example would be Covid19. By
            practising empathy, people can build empathetic connections which
            enhance relationships and performance. <br><br>Practising self-awareness
            allows us to become better decision makers. By being self-aware and
            thinking before speaking, we are able to communicate with more
            clarity and intention. It allows an individual to understand things
            from multiple perspectives rather than narrowing in on one. It can
            allow an individual to listen without bias or assumption. This is
            advantageous while working in software and contributing as an active
            team member.

          I’m the most surprised at how much of the core learning I’ve already
          been practising in my daily life. I’m surprised that the core learning
          has made me more aware of soft skills that will beneficial to me
          within a software environment and through life in general. Having the
          core learning element in Dev Academy is a great way to help people
          grow internally.

      <div>
        <p class="blog-paragraph__paragraph-formatting">
          I found the most challenging aspects for me would have to be actually
          publishing the blogs themselves. The thought of people I don’t know
          possibly reading my blogs, thoughts and plans was a new concept to me.
          I’ve never really posted too much on social media and nothing this
          personal before. The other hard part was deciding how much do I
          actually want to add in my blog about myself and my thoughts. How can
          I convey myself in such a way that I’m happy with my post and then
          uploading it to my blog.

            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
            focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?

        <div>
          <p class="blog-paragraph__paragraph-formatting">
            Dev Academy is focusing heavily on the core learning aspect because
            companies would rather hire a junior developer with a high level of
            key soft skills and a willingness to advance their coding. As a
            junior developer you will be reaching out daily for guidance and
            clarity and that is why is it so crucial that you are a good fit. A
            junior developer who is able to fit nicely into a team is more
            valued than someone who is a high level programmer with no team
            skills.

            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a

            programming instead? Justify your answer.

            I think the time I spent developing and learning the core side to
            Dev Academy has been rewarding. I can continue to learn coding
            through Codecademy, after boot camp and through employment as a
            junior software developer. I’m glad I was able to improve on my core
            skills while learning to code so that I can become a more well
            rounded team member. The material I have learnt through Dev Academy
            has become a vital part of me transitioning from an HVAC Mechanic to
            a Software Developer.
