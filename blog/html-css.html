            In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of
            elements on a web page. When an element has been targeted, a style
            or set of styles can be applied to the element. CSS has a wide range
            of selectors available to customize your project. The two selectors
            most commonly used are class and ID. Both of these selectors are
            used to target elements to which the style should be applied. When
            you design a web page, it requires applying certain styles and
            formatting to get the desired look you want. This is where CSS
            Selectors come into play. Selectors give the user the ability to
            target specific elements on a web page that you can apply styles to.
            CSS has various types of selectors available such as, universal
            selectors, descendant selectors, child selectors, and grouping
            selectors. This blog will just focus on class selectors and id
            selectors. The two selectors, class and id, are used to apply styles
            to elements based on the class and ID assigned to an HTML element.

            See an example in the image below of my cards that are on my home
            page:
          </h2>

          <img
            src="../assets/class-selector-picture.png"
            class="picture-size__picture"

            The left hand side is the HTML file. On the right hand side is the
            CSS file. You can see in the HTML file, each of those individual
            divs are applying the same class “blog-post__card”. This will apply
            the styling defined in the main.css file. If you navigate back to
            the home page of my blog <a href="../index.html"></a>, you will see
            that the 3 cards on the main page are all styled the same. This is
            because they are all using the same class.

        <h1>ID Selector - What is an ID Selector?</h1>

        <p class="css-selectors__paragraph">
          An Id selector is a way to select only the element with a specific id
          and apply styles to that one unique element. The selector must start
          with a hash (#) sign.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h2 class="css-selectors__sub-heading">See the example below:</h2>
        </div>

        <img
          src="../assets/id-selector-picture.png"
          class="picture-size__picture"
          alt="id selector"
        />
      </div>

      <div>
        <div class="css-selectors__heading">
          <h1>Why would you ue an ID Selector?</h1>
        </div>

        <p class="css-selectors__paragraph">
          You would use an Id selector to specify a unique element. Having an
          element with a Id selector is only used to identify one single element
          in our HTML. IDs are only used when one element on the page should
          have a particular style applied to it.
        </p>

        <div class="css-selectors__heading">
          <h1>Summarizing Class vs ID</h1>
        </div>

        <p class="css-selectors__paragraph">
          When deciding what class id you need to use, think about what elements
          you are trying to apply styles too. If for example, if you’re like me,
          I have made multiple cards on my home page that I want to be the exact
          same and have the same styles, you would use the class id. If you have
          a specific element you want to style which is unique, you would use
          the Id selector. The difference between CSS class and ID is that CSS
          class can apply a style to multiple elements. ID can only apply a
          style to one unique element.
