          A situation where I have had to make an ethical decision was when I
          was an apprentice in the HVAC industry, I was told to de-gas some old
          heat pumps taken out of a retirement block. I began use a reclaim
          cylinder (like an LPG bottle to recover gas) and a reclaim unit (a
          machine to pull all the gas out) at the workshop when my boss walked
          down the stairs and told me that there wasn’t enough time to use the
          machine and to make a small hole in the heat pumps and let the gas
          vent out into the atmosphere. <br /><br />I was a new apprentice and
          quite fresh at this stage and was eager to please but on the other
          hand, to vent an HFC refrigerant gas is illegal and destroys the ozone
          layer. <br /><br />The decision I made was to in fact work later than
          expected. Carry out using the reclaim machine and cylinder to legally
          store the gas so It cant get properly destroyed in a facility.
          <br /><br />The consequences of my action was for a decent amount of
          my apprenticeship, I did feel like a got a bit of a hard time from the
          specific manager but at the end of the day I did the right thing. I
          have now been in the same trade for 10 years and to this day I’ve
          never vented refrigerant gas but know many people who have done so to
          save time.

          I come from quite a diverse culture of Latin American and Dutch
          heritage. From a young age, core values like family, honesty and
          determination were instilled into me by my family. <br /><br />A good
          example of family would be, on September the 18th, all my South
          American family gather at a house and celebrate national Chilean
          independence day. We all make traditional dishes accustom to Chile and
          work together to make Chilean empanadas. This event has been taken
          place since my family moved to New Zealand. <br /><br />We also share
          a slightly difference Christmas. We all gather on Christmas Eve, have
          a big pot luck and open all our presents at mid night. I then spend
          the rest of Christmas day with my other side of the family and
          reflecting on the year.

          A strength of mine that I am proud of is my work ethic, and attention
          to detail. I take a lot of pride in my work, and thoroughly enjoy
          providing professional advice, solving problems, and coming up with
          innovative solutions. I can be a perfectionist to a fault, but I
          always enjoy giving things my best effort. <br /><br />Something I
          have always struggled with which limits me is a work-life balance.
          When I left school, I joined the trades and buckled down to save for a
          house. I lived very frugally, and achieved my goal. When I bought the
          house, I started my own business in HVAC. Although running your own
          business comes with its benefits, I am never able to “switch off” due
          to having to respond to emails/calls around the clock, and I working
          throughout the week and weekends. <br /><br />It has come with a lot
          of ongoing stress, and I find that when I am not at work, I am always
          thinking about work/doing paperwork. As work has both busy and quiet
          periods, I feel that you cannot say no to when it comes up, including
          weekends. <br /><br />By not achieving a good work-life balance, I
          felt constantly burnt out which halted forms of career development.
          Having a better structured work-life balance is one of the reasons I
          am pursuing a career change in software development.

          I believe the Dev Academy online cohort foundations core module is
          built on personal development. By being able to look more into myself
          and ask some real questions about who I am, what I believe in, and
          what do I want out of this course, I feel that it is helping me to
          become a better person. <br /><br />From the start of the course,
          there has been a lot of cooperation and team building. Getting to know
          your peers with certain tasks designed around introducing yourself.
          Once the boot camp starts, we will have to code in peers and work as
          teams to build and create products. I’ve been working in teams in my
          professional working career most of my life. Being a tradie involves
          most days working in teams, whether it be with colleagues or other
          trades. Everyone has to tie in with their job to get to finish the
          job. In my career, jobs can be as little as a day or up to one and a
          half years. I think having the core value of cooperation with benefit
          me well by working in a team environment, though my Dev Academy
          experience and into my first job as a junior developer.

          There has been a few jobs I’ve been on when there has been tension
          among some of the trades working closely together because plans
          haven’t been followed correctly and there has been clashes of where
          certain products/ materials can and cant be installed. <br /><br />The
          resistance happened when the team I was working with were installing
          cassette heat pumps into a ceiling of a new build retirement village.
          <br /><br />We couldn’t install 3 cassette heat pumps in the ceiling
          due to the sparkies running there cables right through the middle of
          where they were planned to go. We informed the sparkies and it caused
          some tension as they said they weren’t going to move their cables.
          This caused quite a problem because if we didn’t get our heat pumps in
          the right place, the ceiling wouldn’t line up properly. <br /><br />In
          the end, we went over our plans and checked that they were up to date
          before pushing the matter further. Once we had determined our plans
          were up to date, we asked the sparkies to see their plans and found
          they were out dated. <br /><br />After bringing this to the sparkies
          attention, they agreed to move the cables. <br /><br />Reflecting back
          on this situation, I feel the right steps were followed and were
          effective at getting to the end goal. Other strategies could have
          involved informing the site foreman or one of our general managers
          overseeing our part of the job and letting them sort out the issue.
          This would have let us complete another task and carry on being
          productive. <br /><br />From a trade perspective, I don’t think it
          could have been handled differently and I wouldn’t try any different
          strategy at that point of resistance. The situation was deescalated
          quickly and effectively. If we had taken the matter to the site
          foreman or one of our mangers, the result would have, in my opinion,
          caused some bad blood between the trades and wouldn't have allowed
          both teams to work together amicably on this long project.
