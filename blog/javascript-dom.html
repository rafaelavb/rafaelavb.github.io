          An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and
          CSS?
        </h1>

      <div>
        <p class="blog-paragraph__paragraph-formatting">
          You can describe JavaScript and it’s relationship to HTML and CSS like
          building a modern new house. <br /><br />A new house requires a
          foundation,walls and structure(HTML). It also requires styling, design
          and looks (CSS). A new modern house also needs interactivity
          (JavaScript). <br /><br />This analogy wouldn’t have been possible 10
          years ago in New Zealand but being a tradie working in new homes. More
          often than not now, every new house I’ve worked on has some form of
          functionality. A good example of interactivity would be WiFi
          controlled components like apps for appliances like heating, sensors
          for lighting and security or even painted walls you can tap that
          conduct electricity to turn off lights. <br /><br />Hyper Text Markup
          Language (HTML) defines the content and structure of a website. HTML
          holds everything together and provides a foundation and structure for
          all the information. <br /><br />If HTML is the structure of a
          website, that makes CSS the styling and look of the web page. CSS
          styles the different content in HTML with different attributes.
          <br /><br />Last but not least is JavaScript. Every new house needs
          interactivity as a selling point in 2022. It’s the same with web
          pages. JavaScript interactivity can take many forms. <br /><br />Some
          examples are: <br /><br />Opening and closing windows <br />Displaying
          dialog boxes and pop-up widows <br />Creating forms that respond to
          user input <br />Displaying date and time

        <h1>Control Flow and Loops</h1>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="blog-paragraph__paragraph-formatting">
          In JavaScript, control flow refers to code being executed from top to
          bottom line by line unless it encounters a statement that alters the
          programs control flow. These statements can be Loops, Functions or
          Conditionals. <br /><br />Loops are iterative (repetitive) statements
          that repeat continuously until the condition is false or there is no
          more data to read. It can be compared to reading a book like the
          adventure style goosebumps book. You read up to a certain point,
          choose an action, flick to the page it tells you to go to, read on and
          you either continue the adventure or die.

        <p class="blog-paragraph__paragraph-formatting">
          The Document Object Model or DOM is an object of representation of
          your whole document (HTML and CSS). The browser that you use to view a
          web page creates a representation of the code so that programs can
          access and manipulate the the document structure, style and content.
          The DOM is the glue that holds HTML, CSS together. Everything that
          makes up the DOM is categorized into nodes and objects.
          <br /><br />You can use your development tools to interact with the
          DOM and use a programming language to manipulate the content,
          structure and style of a website. For example you can select HTML tags
          like Classes, Ids (#) and Elements using the document.getElementById()
          and the querySelector()

          Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects

      <div>
        <p class="blog-paragraph__paragraph-formatting">
          An Array stores data in an indexed ordered collection and can be
          accessed through using a numerical index. An array starts at 0 and is
          a single variable that can be added to an object as an attribute.
          <br /><br />For example: <br />0 (Rafael) 1 (Sarah) 2 (James) 3
          (Connor) <br /><br />An object is a data structure in JavaScript which
          is used to represent a ‘thing’. The ‘thing’ can be defined as an
          object like a person, car, or item with key information. Objects
          contain information inside their attributes. An object can hold
          multiple attribute with values. For example: <br /><br />Object:
          Rafael <br />Age: 28 <br />Ethnicity: Kiwi <br />Job: HVAC Mechanic
          <br />Favourite Food: Anything with cheese <br /><br />Object
          attributes can be stored as numbers, booleans, arrays, strings and
          more. Objects can be accessed by calling an objects name and it will
          return all the data attributes linked to the object. You can call
          specific attributes by calling ‘object.attribute’.

        <h1>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h1>

      <div>
        <p class="blog-paragraph__paragraph-formatting">
          A function is a series of instructions used to perform a task. The
          function uses a list of instructions that it will use to complete a
          task or calculate a value, (output from its input). <br /><br />A good
          example of a function would be when when you go to the grocery store
          and end up at the checkout. All the values of the food you want to
          purchase enter a function and the output is the total value you need
          to pay.
