          My long term career pathway would be to find a job as a junior
          developer with a company that has a clear pathway, and enables me
          opportunities to further my learning. I want to be able to become an
          intermediate developer within 2-3 years. When I feel more competent
          and independent with my skill set, I would like to start traveling and
          freelance on the side.

          I am persistent, curious, committed and determined when it comes to
          learning something new. <br />
          <br />I have a huge motivational drive, and throw myself into work
          presented to me.These strengths enable me to deep-dive into new
          topics/concepts, and learn large amounts of information in a short
          period of time. <br />
          <br />However, when I immerse myself quickly, I find myself
          over-committing and over-working. This can quickly lead to me losing
          track of time, and putting too much effort into a single piece of work
          rather than moving on or allowing myself a break.

          During my time a Dev Academy, I’d like to see my time management and
          prioritization skills improve. <br />
          <br />Although I am new to coding, I have been able to develop a
          variety of soft skills due to my time and experience in the trade.
          Some examples of these soft skills include communication, organization
          and cooperation. <br />
          <br />However, completing the exercises and answering these questions
          of reflection set by Dev Academy, I have found that I struggle to
          prioritize time and my time management of tasks.

          Routine, routine, routine. <br />
          <br />I am beginning to change my routine immensely to fit my needs
          for Dev Academy. <br />
          <br />Investing this amount of time can be very damaging without
          proper routine and structure. I know when Boot Camp ramps up, it can
          require 60-70 hours per week to complete the criteria. I've taken
          steps to accommodate this. <br />
          <br />Working as an HVAC mechanic for the past 10 years, I’ve gotten
          used to being on my feet for the majority of the day. Because of this,
          I’ve brought a sit/stand desk to try maintain part of my old working
          environment. <br />
          <br />I’ve made a study nook in my house which is bright, quiet and
          tidy. I rent some rooms in my house to my friends, but they are
          supportive and aware of my time commitments to Dev Academy. They are
          respectful during the times I am doing my coursework. <br /><br />When
          I hit a block and find myself spending too much time on a task needing
          help, my first option would be to use my good mate Google. The
          downside to using Google is that due to being quite green in software
          development, I don’t actually know some of the jargon used. You don’t
          know what you don’t know, so sometimes I don’t actually know what to
          search for to help me with my issue. This can send me down the rabbit
          hole, and suck up a lot of time. <br /><br />Discord would be my next
          option as chances are, someone else in one of the cohorts has already
          run into the same problem. <br /><br />If I fail to find a solution
          through these avenues, I’d then put out a message to one of the
          facilitators for some guidance. <br /><br />I’m sure many of the
          facilitation team have trained plenty of cohorts before me. Because of
          their experience with many others, I would expect them to have amazing
          communication skills, problem solving skills, empathy, and guidance.
          They have already helped me keep on track with the Monday zoom
          meetings, and when I have needed their help when I have gotten stuck.
