          By understanding neuroplasticity, you understand the scientific backed
          evidence that the brain is malleable and that you can change brain
          cells in response to your behavior through the course of your life.
          The more active we are at engaging and challenging our mind and body,
          the longer our brain will function at a higher level. These responses
          can benefit people by allowing us to more thoughtfully engage in
          activities/life that will contribute to our well being.

            There are many ways to engage with the principles. In my opinion,
            you first must actually believe in and be open to the concept.
            Becoming engaged in neuroplasticity requires you to pick a skill
            that should be new to you. It should be relatively hard and you
            should show some interest in it. Practising the skill allows you to
            engage the principles of neuroplasticity. <br /><br /><b

        <h1>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h1>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="blog-paragraph__paragraph-formatting">
          You can increase neuroplasticity in a number of ways.
          <br /><br />Firstly, you need to think of your brain as a muscle. The
          more you exercise your brain correctly the more powerful it ill
          become. <br /><br />Your brain can use up to a quarter of what you eat
          so having a balanced healthy diet rich in Vitamin D and magnesium can
          promote neuroplasticity. Research shows that having between 7-9 hours
          sleep with a 20 minute nap in the afternoon can promote your
          neuroplasticity even higher. Creating downtime and creating an “end of
          the day” ritual that includes reflection and gratitude boosts
          endorphins which creates perfect conditions for neuroplasticty.
          <br /><br />Other tasks like using the non-dominant hand forms new
          neural pathways and will strengthen connectivity between existing
          neurons.

            informative. It also has a table which gives you 5 components, how
            they work and how to use them to get started.

            A growth mindset is a form of view that your abilities are
            changeable and something you can improve through with exercise and
            practise. <br /><br />Growth mindset factors: <br />You see failure
            as a chance to learn and pivot <br />See critical feedback as a
            chance to improve and develop <br />More likely to embrace
            challenges and tackle them head on working hard to improve
            <br />View obstacles as a chance to experiment and solve problem
            <br /><br />Mindset influences everything from creative risk-taking
            to how you view feedback or whether or not you finish difficult
            tasks. Having a growth mindset is one of the biggest factors in
            determining whether or not you grow and improve in your abilities.

            I was surprised with these terms and how you could actually change
            the neuroplasticty of your brain. I knew as an adult you could learn
            new tasks, strengthen you brain and continue to grow, but not to
            this extent. I’m looking back on my last 3 weeks at Dev Academy and
            what I’ve accomplished, what I've learnt with my growth mindset
            without actually know there was a term for this. I’ve just been
            trying to be as positive as possible while taking in vast amounts of
            new information and putting it to practise.

            Learning about neuroplasticty and the growth mindset gives me a lot
            reassurance that I can tackle problems that will arise through the
            last weeks of foundations and boot camp. <br /><br />For me,
            JavaScript Intro was an extremely hard exercise. I kept a positive
            mindset and slowly worked through the sprint. The questions were
            challenging and the constant white screens from when I put in wrong
            code showed me that I did use some of the factors I’ve listed
            above.Failure as a chance to learn and pivot - I broke the answer

            viewed the questions as obstacles that I needed to pass to get to
            the end goal, Boot Camp I become more willing to embrace questions

            them.
