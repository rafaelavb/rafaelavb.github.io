          In sprint one when I was learning HTML and CSS, I got stuck trying to
          format my index page. The index page to my blog kept expanding higher
          than the screen limit and you would have to scroll out to 40% zoom to
          see the top of the page on a screen. I kept going through the code,
          using the process of elimination with the comment out function to no
          avail. Many hours passed and many breaks were taken before I gave up
          and accepted my fate. People were just going to have to zoom out on my
          front page if they wanted to see it. Around 4 day passed of me
          pretending there wasn’t an issue before I decided to dive back into
          the code. I decided to add a nav bar and when I was mucking around
          with the css, I scrolled up to the top of my file and saw I had added
          a value which referenced the height of the front page which made it
          blow out to around 3 screens high. I deleted the line and the whole
          page fell into place.

            A problem I elegantly solved would have been all of the JS Intro
            Conditionals. I really struggled with with JS Intro as a whole. I’m
            extremely green at coding and was having issues with my conditionals
            until I figured out how Dev Academy wanted me to structure the
            answers. I was over complicating everything. Once I figured that
            part out I used the math I learnt in school and breezed through that
            part. I felt pretty pleased to breeze though that leg to give me
            more time on other parts of JS Intro. In both cases, I’ve learnt not
            to sweat the small stuff and look at the bigger picture. If I
            compare myself at the start of sprint 1 to the start of sprint 4,
            I’ve learnt a heap of new things in such small space of time.

            feel reasonably confident using most of these techniques. I think my
            Googling will improve over time when I learn more jargon and begin
            to narrow down and hone my searches. I had never heard of the Rubber
            Ducky Method which gave me a laugh, Maybe I need to buy one myself.
            Console.logging is coming along and has helped me a few times break
            own code. I think I can work on Pseudocode but in my opinion this
            will get better as I start to understand more about coding through
            the coming weeks.
